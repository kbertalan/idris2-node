# idris2-node

A Library to match NodeJS 16 LTS APIs. Main source of adopted APIs is the [official NodeJS 16.x documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/documentation.html).

The status of this library is experimental. Almost all parts are considered incomplete, but serving the needs of [TyTTP](https://github.com/kbertalan/tyttp).

Use at your own risk.

Contributions are welcome.
